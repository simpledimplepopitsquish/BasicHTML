        In this example, the preconnect value for the rel attribute tells the browser to create an early connection to 
        the value specified in the href attribute. This is done to speed up loading times for these external resources.-->

        is a small icon typically displayed in the browser tab next the site title. 
        A lot of websites will use a favicon to display their brand icon.-->

<!--What is the HTML boilerplate, you ask? It's like a ready-made template for your webpages.
A boilerplate includes the basic structure and essential elements every HTML document needs. 
It saves you time and helps ensure your pages are set up properly. Here is an example:

<!DOCTYPE html> First, there is the DOCTYPE declaration. It tells browsers which version of HTML you're using.

<html lang="en"> Next, comes the html tag. This wraps around all your content, 
and can specify the language of your page.

Inside the html tag, you'll find two main sections - a head, and a body:

  <head>
    The head section contains important behind-the-scenes information.

    Your site's metadata, contained in meta elements, has details about things like character encoding, 
    and how websites like Twitter should preview your page's link. 

    <meta charset="utf-8" /> UTF-8, or UCS Transformation Format 8, is a standardized character encoding 
    widely used on the web. Character encoding is the method computers use to store characters as data.
    Essentially, all text on a web page is a sequence of characters stored as one or more bytes. 
    In computing, a byte is a unit of data consisting of 8 bits, or binary digits. 
    UTF-8 supports every character in the Unicode character set - and this includes characters and symbols 
    from all writing systems, languages, and technical symbols.
    For each new project you create, you should include this meta element with the charset attribute set to UTF-8!

    <meta
       name="viewport"
       content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" 
    />

    <title>freeCodeCamp</title> Your site's title, found in the title element, 
    determines the text that appears in the browser tab or window.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" /> Finally, you'll typically link your page's external stylesheets 
    in the head section using link elements.
