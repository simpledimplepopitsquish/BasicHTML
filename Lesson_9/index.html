    <!-- The audio and video elements allow you to add sound and video content to your HTML documents. 
     The audio element supports popular audio formats like mp3, wav, and ogg. 
     The video element supports mp4, ogg, and webm formats. To include audio content on your web page, 
     you can use the audio element with the src attribute pointing to the location of your audio file.-->
    <audio src="https://lambda.vgmtreasurechest.com/soundtracks/hatsune-miku-project-diva-mega39-s-10th-anniversary-collection/lymngody/1-06.%20Melt.mp3" 
    controls
    loop 
    ></audio>
    <!-- The controls attribute adds playback controls like play, pause, and volume to the audio player. 
    There are several other attributes that enhance the functionality of the audio element.
    The loop attribute is a boolean attribute that makes the audio replay continuously.
    Another attribute you can use is the muted attribute. 
    When present in the audio element, this boolean attribute will start the audio in a muted state-->

    <audio controls> 
        <source src="https://lambda.vgmtreasurechest.com/soundtracks/hatsune-miku-project-diva-mega39-s-10th-anniversary-collection/kjqzzbhj/2-01.%20PoPiPo.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
        <source src="audio.wav" type="audio/wav" />
        <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/ogg" />
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio><!-- The source element allows you to specify multiple audio files in different formats. 
    This is useful for ensuring compatibility across different browsers, as not all browsers support 
    the same audio formats.
    The type attribute specifies the MIME type of the audio file, which helps the browser determine 
    if it can play the file.
    If the browser does not support the audio element, the text between the opening and closing audio 
    tags will be displayed as a fallback message.-->

    <!--All the attributes we have learned so far are also supported in the video element. 
    Here's an example of using a video element with the loop, controls, and muted attributes.-->
    <video
        src="https://ia902302.us.archive.org/17/items/BiliBili-BV1Bx411q7Mn_p89-1M6B1VB/BV1Bx411q7Mn_p89.mp4"
        loop
        controls
        muted
        poster="https://peach.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/title_anouncement.jpg?x11217"
        width="400"
    ></video>
    <!-- The width attribute specifies the width of the video player in pixels.
    The height attribute can also be used to set the height of the video player.
    The poster attribute specifies an image to be shown while the video is downloading,
    or until the user hits the play button.-->
