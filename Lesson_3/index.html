<!-- Most elements will have an opening tag and a closing tag.-->
<p>I love coding!</p>

<!-- Some elements are self-closing and do not have a closing tag.These are known as void elements.-->

<!--If you wanted to display an image, you will need to include a couple of attributes inside your image element. 
An attribute is a special value used to adjust the behavior for an HTML element.
The src attribute is used to specify the location for that image. 
For image elements, it's good practice to include another attribute called the alt attribute. 
The alt attribute is used to provide short, descriptive text for the images.-->

<!--HTML is for the content and structure. CSS is for styling. JavaScript is for adding interactivity to your web pages.-->

<!--An attribute is a value placed inside the opening tag of an HTML element. 
Attributes provide additional information about the element or specify how the element should behave.
The attribute name is followed by an equal sign (=) and a value in quotes. 
The value can be a string or a number, depending on the attribute.
This first example uses the href and target attributes. 
The href attribute specifies the URL of a link and the target attribute specifies where to open the link.
Without the href attribute, the link would not work because there would be no destination URL. 
So you must include this href attribute to make the link functional. 
The target="__blank" enables the link to open in a new browser tab.-->

<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">This link opens in a new tab or window</a>
<br>

<!--Similar to the href attribute, the src attribute is required because it specifies the image file to be displayed. 
The alt attribute is not required, but it is recommended for accessibility purposes. 
Accessibility means making sure that everyone, including those with disabilities, 
can use and understand things like websites, apps, and physical spaces. -->

<!--Some attributes are a little unique with their syntax like the checked attribute.
Here we have an input element with the type attribute set to checkbox. 
Inputs are used to collect data from users, and the type attribute specifies the type of input. 
In this case, this input is a checkbox.-->
<br>
<input type="checkbox" checked />
<!--Remove the checked attribute from the input in the interactive editor, 
and you will see that the checkbox is no longer checked by default.-->
<input type="checkbox"/>

<!--There are several common BOOLEAN attributes you will encounter in HTML, such as disabled, readonly, and required. 
Here is an example of a text input element that is disabled by default.-->
<br>
<input type="text" disabled>
<!--Remove the disabled attribute from the input in the interactive editor, and you will see that the input is no longer disabled.-->
<input type="text">
