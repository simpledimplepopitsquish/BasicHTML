    <!--SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a practice that optimizes web pages so they become more visible 
    and rank higher on search engines. One way to improve your site's SEO, is to provide a short description 
    for the web page using the meta element.-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="description" content="This is Lesson 8"> <!--By setting the name attribute to description, 
    it ensures that browsers, search engines, and other web tools correctly interpret this metadata. 
    The content attribute is where you will place your description. 
    It is recommended that you keep your descriptions short and concise.
    One place where the page description can be found is in the search engine results page snippet-->
    <meta content="freeCodeCamp.org" property="og:title" /> <!--The open graph protocol enables you to control 
    how your website's content appears across various social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, 
    and many more. By setting these open graph properties, you can entice users to want to click and engage
    with your content. For the property attribute, you will need to specify that it is og:title. 
    The content attribute is where you will write the title you want displayed for social media sites.-->
    <meta property="og:type" content="website" /><!--The og:type property is used to specify the type 
    of content being shared.
    This helps social media platforms understand how to display and categorize the content appropriately.
    Examples of this content include articles, websites, videos, or music.-->
    <meta
        content="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png"
        property="og:image"
    /><!--The og:image property is used to specify the image that will be displayed 
    when your content is shared on social media platforms. 
    In this example, the open graph image is pointing to the freeCodeCamp logo.-->
    <meta property="og:url" content="https://www.freecodecamp.org" /><!--The og:url property is used to specify 
    the canonical URL of the page being shared.
    This helps social media platforms understand the original source of the content and ensures that any shares 
    or likes are attributed to the correct URL.-->

    <!--There are many more OG properties that you can set, like description, audio, video and locale. 
    However, the open graph url, image, type, and title are the most important ones to include.
    
    So how do these open graph properties affect Search Engine Optimization? 
    When your content is shared on social media, well-crafted OG properties can enhance the appearance 
    for your content in users' feeds. This can lead to higher click-through rates which could signal 
    to search engines that your content is relevant and engaging.-->
