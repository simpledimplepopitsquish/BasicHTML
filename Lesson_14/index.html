    <!-- target attribute tells the browser where to open the URL for the anchor element. 
     There are four important possible values for this attribute.

    _self - default value. opens the link in the current browsing context.

    _blank -  opens the link in a new browsing context.

    _parent - opens the link in the parent of the current context. 
    For example, if your website has an iframe, 
    a _parent value in that iframe would open in your website's tab/window, not in the embedded frame.
    
    _top - opens the link in the topmost browsing context. "the parent of the parent".
    This is similar to _parent, but the link will always open in the full browser tab/window, 
    even for nested embedded frames.

    _unfencedTop - opens the link in the topmost browsing context that is not fenced. 
    currently used for the experimental FencedFrame API.

    <!--What Is the Difference Between Absolute and Relative Paths?-->

    <!-- An absolute path is a complete link to a resource. It starts from the root directory, 
    includes every other directory, and finally the filename and extension. 
    The "root directory" refers to the top-level directory or folder in a hierarchy.
    An absolute path also includes the protocol - which could be http, https, 
    and file and the domain name if the resource is on the web.-->
    <a href="https://design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org/img/fcc_secondary_small.svg">
    View fCC Logo
    </a>
    <!--In this example, the protocol is https, the domain name is design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org, 
    and the filename is fcc_secondary_small.svg.-->

    <!--Now, what if the resource you want to link to using an absolute path is on your local machine? 
    Here's how to link to the about.html file with an absolute path:
    <p>
       Read more on the
       <a href="/Users/user/Desktop/fCC/script-code/absolute-vs-relative-paths/pages/about.html">
        About Page
       </a>
    </p>
    It looks like this because we are going into a folder called Users, 
    then into a folder called user, then into a folder called Desktop, 
    then into a folder called fCC, then into a folder called script-code, 
    then into a folder called absolute-vs-relative-paths, 
    then into a folder called pages to finally get the about.html file.

    Here's what the absolute URL looks like in the browser address bar:
    file:///Users/user/Desktop/fCC/script-code/absolute-vs-relative-paths/pages/about.html

    The URL includes the protocol, file://. 
    It also include the path, which looks like this: 
    /Users/user/Desktop/fCC/script-code/absolute-vs-relative-paths/pages/, 
    and represents the series of folders that lead to the file. 
    And finally, it also includes the about.html, which is the filename and the extension.
    -->

    <!--A relative path specifies the location of a file relative to the directory of the current file.
    It does not include the protocol or the domain name, 
    making it shorter and more flexible for internal links within the same website.
    
    <p>
        Read more on the
        <a href="about.html">About Page</a>
    </p>
    So imagine you are on the contact.html page, and because the about.html page is in the same place, you simply get the filename. 
    This is an example of using a relative file path.

    короче говоря, относительный путь зависит от текущего местоположения файла,
    тогда как абсолютный путь всегда указывает на одно и то же место независимо от текущего местоположения файла.

    <ul>
        <li>Use absolute paths when linking to a resource hosted on an external website.</li>
        <li>Use absolute paths when you need the link to a page or resource to work consistently regardless of the document location within the site.</li>
        <li>Use relative paths when linking to resources within the same website.</li> 
        <li>Use relative paths if you want to keep your code cleaner and easier to maintain during development.</li> 
        <li> Use relative paths during local testing to ensure links work without an internet connection.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--file paths-->
    <!--There are three key syntaxes to know. 
    First is the slash, which can be a backslash (\) or forward slash (/) depending on your operating system. 
    The second is the single dot (.). 
    And finally, we have the double dot (..).
    
    The slash is known as the "path separator". 
    It is used to indicate a break in the text between folder or file names. 
    This is how your computer knows that naomis-files/ points to a directory of that same name, 
    while naomis/files/ points to a files directory in the naomis directory.

    A single dot points to the current directory, and two dots point to the parent directory. 
    For example, if you are in the /home/user/documents/ directory, 
    ./notes.txt would refer to the notes.txt file in the documents directory, 
    while ../pictures/image.jpg would refer to the image.jpg file in the pictures directory, 
    which is one level up from documents.-->


    <!--Link States-->
    <!--Links can have different states based on user interaction.-->
    <!--The unvisited state is the default state of a link that has not been clicked on yet.-->
        <p>
            <a href="#" style="color: blue;">Unvisited</a>
        </p>
        <!--The visited state indicates that the user has already clicked on the link.-->
        <p>
            <a href="#" style="color: purple;">Visited</a>
        </p>
        <!--The hover state occurs when the user places their cursor over the link without clicking it.-->
        <p>
            <a id="hover" href="#">Hover</a>
        </p>
        <!--The focus state occurs when the link is selected, typically through keyboard navigation(Tab).-->
        <p>
            <a id="focus" href="#">Focus</a>
        </p>
        <!--Active state applies to links that are being activated by the user. 
        This typically means clicking on the link with the primary mouse button by left clicking, 
        in most cases.-->
        <p>
            <a href="#" style="color: red;">Active</a>
        </p>

        <!--When you use these states to style your links, there is a specific order you need to write your CSS in: 
        link, visited, hover, focus, then active.-->
