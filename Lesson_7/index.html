    <!--The script element is used to embed executable code. 
    Most developers will use this to execute JavaScript code. 
    JavaScript is used to add interactivity to your web pages. 
    Common examples of using JavaScript include interactive games, image sliders, and dynamic forms 
    that validate user input in real-time.-->
    <script>
        alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp");
    </script>
    <!--While you can technically write all of your JavaScript code inside the script tags, 
    it is considered best practice to link to an external JavaScript file instead. 
    Here is an example of using the script element to link to an external JavaScript file
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    The src attribute is used here to specify the location for that external JavaScript file. 
    src stands for "source". 
    The reason why it is not encouraged to place all of your JavaScript inside the HTML document 
    is because of separation of concerns.
    Separation of concerns is a design principle where you separate your programs into distinct sections 
    and have each section address a separate concern. 
    In this case, we want to separate our JavaScript code from our HTML code.

        <!--You can reference the id name of title within your JavaScript or CSS. 
        Here's a CSS example referencing the id of title to change the text color to red.-->
        <h1 id="title">Red text</h1>
         <!-- The div element is used as a container to group other elements. 
         You will mainly use the div element when you want to group HTML elements 
         that will share a set of CSS styles.-->
        <div class="box"> <!--The class attribute is used to specify one or more class names for an HTML element. 
            The class name can be used by CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements.
            In contrast to the id attribute, the class attribute value does not need to be unique and can 
            contain spaces.-->

            <p>One more paragraph element.</p>

        you should be careful not to overuse it. There are times when another element would be more appropriate.-->

        <!--The section element has semantic meaning over the div element which is not semantic. 
        Semantics are the meaning of words or phrases in a language. 
        In HTML, which is a language, elements have their own semantic meaning too. 
        So, this means if you use a section element, the browser will pick up its semantic meaning and 
        understand to treat this as a section - on desktops, mobiles, you name it.-->

            <h2>London</h2>
            <p>Is the capital of Great Britain.</p>

        <div class="box red-box"></div>

        <!--Classes are best used when you want to apply a set of styles to many elements. 
        If you want to target a specific element, it is best to use id because those values need to be unique.-->
        <!--When the HTML parser sees the less than (<) symbol followed by an HTML tag name, 
        it interprets that as an HTML element. To fix this issue, you can use HTML entities.-->

        <!--These types of character references are known as named character references. 
        Named references start with an ampersand sign (&) and end with a semicolon (;). 
        By using a named character reference, the HTML parser will not confuse this with an actual HTML element.-->
        <p>the copyright symbol &#169; and the trademark symbol &#174;</p>
        <!--Another type of character reference would be the decimal numeric reference. 
        This character reference starts with an ampersand sign and hash symbol (#), 
        followed by one or more decimal digits, followed by a semicolon.-->
        <p>the euro symbol &#x20AC; and &#x03A9; Greek capital letter Omega</p>
